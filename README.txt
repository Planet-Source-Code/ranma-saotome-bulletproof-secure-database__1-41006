BULLETPROOF DATABASE FOR PASSWORDS AND NETBANKING


IF YOU WANT TO EDIT THE DATABASE FROM WITHIN WINDOWS YOU HAVE TO
DO FOLLOWING:

OPEN THE SHORTCUT.ICO BY RIGHTCLICKING AND SEE ITS PROPERTIES,
EDIT THE GIVEN PATH TO THE MICROSOFT ACCESS OF YOUR COMPUTER; 
EDIT THE GIVEN PATH TO THE DB1.MDB SO IT FITS YOUR COMPUTER;
EIDT THE GIVEN PATH TO THE DB1.MDW SO IT FITS ALSO YOUR COMPUTER;

WHEN YOU VE DONE EVERYTHING ALLRIGHT MS ACCESS WILL OPEN AND ASK YOU
FOR USERNAME AND PASSWORD!



USERNAME: 			AKANETENOD 	(NO SPACE)
PASSWORD: 			!:wW39kP19oO  	(CASE SENSITIVE)

USERNAME FOR THE PROGRAM IS: 	ADMINISTRATOR
PASSWORD FOR THE PROGRAM IS: 	Password	(CASE SENSITIV)




IF YOU VE DONE ANYTHING WRONG IT WILL TELL YOU YOU DONT HAVE THE RIGHTS
TO OPEN THE DATABASE OR YOU HAVE TO ASK AN ADMIN TO GIVE YOU THE PRIVILEGS.
ONCE YOU ENTERED THE PATH TO THE FILES CORRECTLY IT WILL ALWAYS LEAD YOU
TO THE USERNAME PASSWORD INTERFACE OF THE DATABASE.

NOTE: THE DB1.MDB IS THE DATABASE AND THE DB1.MDW IS THE USER/PASSWORD FILE
YOU ALWAYS NEED THEM BOTH!

ENCRYPTION USED IN THIS APPLICATION:

FULL CREDITS TO  David Midkiff, Mark McConnel, Caleb Walters
PLEASE VISIT THEIR WEBSITE AND READ THE CRYPTANALYSIS FOR MORE INFOS.
ALL YOUR PASSWORDS WILL BE KEPT IN THEIR ENCRYPTED HEX VALUE ONLY!!! INSIDE 
THE DATABASE SO EVEN THE DATABASE IS CRACKED YOUR PASSWORDS ARE SAFE.

In my opinion the DS2 class is perfect for encrypting passwords cause even the
same 2 passwords encrypted dont look the same.
please always choose good passwords.
